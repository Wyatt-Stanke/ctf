# Copilot Instructions

## General

- This repository contains CTF challenges with path-specific instructions files.
- Keep all challenge documentation under `.github/instructions/<challenge>/<name>/` (two subdirectories).
- For compiler-related instructions, use `.github/instructions/compiler/core/`.
- Always read each challenge's `*.instructions.md` files before making changes.
- The instructions files include an `applyTo` frontmatter block and apply to specific paths.
- After any change to a challenge, create/update/delete instructions files as needed to reflect the changes.
