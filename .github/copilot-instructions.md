# Copilot Instructions

## General

- This repository contains CTF challenges with path-specific instructions files.
- Keep all challenge documentation under `.github/instructions/<challenge>/<name>/` (two subdirectories).
- Always read each challenge's `*.instructions.md` files before making changes.
- The instructions files include an `applyTo` frontmatter block and apply to specific paths.
- After any change to a challenge, update its `structure.instructions.md` and `cross-references.instructions.md` as needed.
