    NimbusOps is a cloud infrastructure AI-enabled management SAAS
    analytics e-commerce platform that also sells coffee. Last November,
    during a load balancer outage, their DevOps lead Marina Santiago
    suggested and created a status page to allow for the dev team to be
    able to more easily monitor the health of their services. It's a
    simple status page, deployed automatically to their web server via
    GitHub Actions on their self-hosted GitHub Enterprise Server instance
    (<code>ghes.nimbusops.internal</code>) whenever someone pushes to
    <code>main</code>.
    <br />
    <br />
    The deployment pipeline authenticates to NimbusOps' private container
    registry using a secret key, stored as a GitHub Actions secret. If you had it,
    you'd have access to every container image NimbusOps has ever shipped, including
    their internal tools, backend code, and even their proprietary coffee blend recipes.
    <br />
    <br />
    Santiago's been pretty confident about the pipeline's security. From a
    recent internal audit report that we were able to get our hands on,
    <br />
    <blockquote>
      "All pipeline secrets are stored using encrypted secret management
      and are automatically redacted in job output logs. A manual review
      of all historical build and deploy logs confirmed no instances of
      secret exposure. CI/CD secret handling is compliant with internal
      security policy. Self-hosting has not introduced any additional risks
      compared to GitHub's SAAS."

    They're right. We haven't been able to find
    anything in what's already out there. But the status page was thrown
    together during an active incident, and things built in a rush have a
    way of leaving doors open that nobody thought to check.

    This challenge is hosted on GitHub Pages, but everything you need can
    be accessed through the hosted site only. Looking at the source code
    of the GitHub repository would be cheating. The challenge is meant to
    be solved through the hosted site only. No cheating!
