 * BACKEND EMULATOR

 *
 * PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS CODE!
 *
 * This code is meant to serve as the "backend" for the CTF. Since this is a static site, we have to emulate the backend in JavaScript.
 * This file is that emulation. It is intentionally obfuscated and not meant to be read or understood by participants. If you would
 * like to check out the backend after you're done with the CTF, you can look at the source code on GitHub.
 *
 * Reading this before solving is discouraged as it is cheating!
