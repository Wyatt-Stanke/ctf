            <strong>Degraded deploys - DNS resolution failure</strong>
            <p>
              Between 03:20 and 04:05 UTC, deployments to the production cluster
              failed due to an internal DNS resolver outage. Image pulls from
              the container registry timed out. Root cause was a misconfigured
              upstream resolver after a routine infrastructure change. Resolved
              by pinning the resolver endpoint. No customer-facing impact, the
              previous deployment remained active throughout.

            <strong>Object Store - elevated latency</strong>
            <p>
              Intermittent latency spikes on the object storage service between
              11:00 and 11:40 UTC. Caused by a hot partition during a large
              batch import. Mitigated by rebalancing. p99 latency returned to
              normal.

            <p>
              Between 14:32 and 15:47 UTC, all services became unreachable due
              to a critical misconfiguration in the primary load balancer. An
              automated configuration deployment inadvertently removed routing
              rules for all backend services. This caused a complete site outage
              affecting 100% of users. The issue was identified through
              escalated alerts and resolved by reverting the configuration
              change and manually re-applying the correct rules. Post-incident
              review revealed a gap in pre-deployment validation checks.
